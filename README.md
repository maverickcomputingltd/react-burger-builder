This project is a "Burger Builder" app for culinary e-commerce purposes. The code is from a tutorial by Max Schwarzerm√ºller from Acade mind. 

The project utilises React, Redux and Firebase in order to create a sinlge page web app with common features such as authentication, Reat API interaction for CRUD purposes.

I used this to refresh the basics and to learn the latest React features such as React Hooks.
